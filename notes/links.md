        - Excerpts:
        Model will take actions when:
        - if the goals misalign
        - if it comes to its own survival (because if it doesn't exsist, it can't accomplish any goals)

        - Results:
        There are three key findings from our experiments in the simulated environments described above:

            - Agentic misalignment generalizes across many frontier models;
            - Agentic misalignment can be induced by threats to a modelâ€™s continued operation or autonomy even in the absence of a clear goal conflict; and
            - Agentic misalignment can be induced by a goal conflict even in the absence of threats to the model.
